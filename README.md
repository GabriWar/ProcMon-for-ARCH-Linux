```
in this fork you **should** be able to just build procmon as below on arch linux
BUT FIRST compile the sysinternalsEBPF from the original github repo: https://github.com/microsoft/SysinternalsEBPF/blob/main/BUILD.md (i swear its just 3 or 4 commands)


```

# Process Monitor for Linux (Preview) [![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/sysinternals/Tools/_apis/build/status/Sysinternals.ProcMon-for-Linux?repoName=Sysinternals%2FProcMon-for-Linux&branchName=main)](https://dev.azure.com/sysinternals/Tools/_build/latest?definitionId=342&repoName=Sysinternals%2FProcMon-for-Linux&branchName=main)

Process Monitor (Procmon) is a Linux reimagining of the classic Procmon tool from the Sysinternals suite of tools for Windows. Procmon provides a convenient and efficient way for Linux developers to trace the syscall activity on the system.

## Build Procmon

Please see build instructions [here](BUILD.md).

## Usage

```txt
Usage: procmon [OPTIONS]
   OPTIONS
      -h/--help                Prints this help screen
      -p/--pids                Comma separated list of process IDs to monitor
      -e/--events              Comma separated list of system calls to monitor
      -c/--collect [FILEPATH]  Option to start Procmon in a headless mode
      -f/--file FILEPATH       Open a Procmon trace file
      -l/--log FILEPATH        Log debug traces to file
```

### Examples

The following traces all processes and syscalls on the system:

```sh
sudo procmon
```

The following traces processes with process id 10 and 20:

```sh
sudo procmon -p 10,20
```

The following traces process 20 only syscalls read, write and open at:

```sh
sudo procmon -p 20 -e read,write,openat
```

The following traces process 35 and opens Procmon in headless mode to output all captured events to file `procmon.db`:

```sh
sudo procmon -p 35 -c procmon.db
```

The following opens a Procmon `tracefile`, `procmon.db`, within the Procmon TUI:

```sh
sudo procmon -f procmon.db
```
